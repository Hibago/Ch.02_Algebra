HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Varun V. Vepa

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
#you use a hashtag



WHY DO THEY GIVE THESE ANSWERS
2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 = 0.66666666666
2 // 3 = 0
3/2 = 1.5
3//2 = 1





3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
It doesn't do anything because lower case a doesn't have an assigned value






4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle
The best one to use is area_of_rectangle



INCORRECT. There are several that are wrong, Test them out
5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2 X
1Apple X
account number X
account_number
account.number
accountNumber X
account# X
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable X
great_big_variable
great.big.variable X
2x X
x2x X
total% X
#left X





INCORRECT!
6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10 should equal 20
a/=2 should equal 1
a+=12 should equal 14
a-=7 should equal -5
a should equal 2
type(a) says <class 'int'>







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area
line 94 is redundant, it could just be x = 3.14, or pi = 3.14, and then putting either x or pi in line 95





8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42) <class 'int'>
type(42.0) <class 'float'>
type("C3PO") <class 'str'>
type(True) <class 'bool'>







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
a = 3*(x+y)






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
the code should be ave=(x+y+z)/3, so it adds up all the terms before dividing by the number of terms
