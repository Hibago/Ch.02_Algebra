HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Signed: Varun V. Vepa

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
#you use a hashtag




2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 = 0.66666666666
2 // 3 = 0
3/2 = 1.5
3//2 = 1





3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b
It doesn't do anything because lower case a doesn't have an assigned value






4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle
The best one to use is area_of_rectangle




5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple
Apple
APPLE
Apple2 X
1Apple X
account number X
account_number
account.number
accountNumber X
account# X
pi
PI
fred
Fred
GreatBigVariable
greatBigVariable X
great_big_variable
great.big.variable X
2x X
x2x X
total% X
#left X






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10 should equal 20
a/=2 should equal 1
a+=12 should equal 14
a-=7 should equal -5
a should equal 2
type(a) says <class 'int'>







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area
line 94 is redundant, it could just be x = 3.14, or pi = 3.14, and then putting either x or pi in line 95





8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42) <class 'int'>
type(42.0) <class 'float'>
type("C3PO") <class 'str'>
type(True) <class 'bool'>







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
a = 3*(x+y)






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
the code should be ave=(x+y+z)/3, so it adds up all the terms before dividing by the number of terms
